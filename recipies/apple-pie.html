	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<div class="lists">
	<ol>
		<li><p>Put a layer of paper towels on a large baking sheet.</p><p>Quarter, core, peel and slice the apples about 5mm thick and lay
		evenly on the baking sheet. Put paper towels on top and set aside while you make and chill the pastry.</p></li>
		<li><p>For the pastry, beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until just mixed. Break in a whole egg and a yolk (keep the
		white for glazing later).</p><p>Beat together for just under 1 min it will look a bit like scrambled egg. Now work in the
		flour with a wooden spoon, a third at a time, until it is beginning to clump up, then finish gathering it together with
		your hands.</p><p>Gently work the dough into a ball, wrap in cling film, and chill for 45 mins. Now mix the 140g/5oz sugar,
		the cinnamon and flour for the filling in a bowl that is large enough to take the apples later.</p></li>
		<li><p>After the pastry has chilled, heat the oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Lightly beat the egg white with a fork. Cut off a
		third of the pastry and keep it wrapped while you roll out the rest, and use this to line a pie tin 20-22cm round and
		4cm deep leaving a slight overhang.</p><p>Roll the remaining third to a circle about 28cm in diameter. Pat the apples dry
		with kitchen paper, and tip them into the bowl with the cinnamon-sugar mix. Give a quick mix with your hands and
		immediately pile high into the pastry-lined tin.</p></li>
		<li><p>Brush a little water around the pastry rim and lay the pastry lid over the apples pressing the edges together to seal.
		Trim the edge with a sharp knife and make 5 little slashes on top of the lid for the steam to escape.</p><p>(Can be frozen at
		this stage.) Brush it all with the egg white and sprinkle with caster sugar. Bake for 40-45 mins, until golden, then
		remove and let it sit for 5-10 mins.</p><p>Sprinkle with more sugar and serve while still warm from the oven with softly
		whipped cream</p>.</li>
